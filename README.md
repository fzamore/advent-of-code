# advent-of-code

My solutions to Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/). Some notes:
* I haven't cleaned up the code as much as I should, so there's lots of copypasta and general ugliness. 
* For each puzzle, I stopped editing once I got the correct answer.
* Input files aren't included, but they should be named 'dayX.txt'.
