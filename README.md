# advent-of-code

My solutions to Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/). Some notes:
* I haven't cleaned up the code as much as I should, so there's lots of copypasta and general ugliness. 
* There's a mix of puzzles where I've left the code in an ugly state and where I've made it half-decent.
* Input files aren't included, but they should be named 'dayX.txt'.
